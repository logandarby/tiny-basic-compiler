- add labels and comments to lexer
- make ast nodeIDs a linked list I think.
- string pool (arena) should be interned using a hashmap inside the lexer
- implement parser ast from tokenarray
- maybe come up with better way to handle token array shared memory?
- implement basic emitter
- implement some basic optimizations (tail end recursion, constexpr, etc.)
