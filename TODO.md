- [ ] implement basic emitter
  - After some basic research, it seems like x86-64 assembly might be the best
- [ ] Create basic semantic analyzer for variables
- [ ] add labels and comments to lexer
- [ ] right now, the contiguous array of nodes doesn't support deletion without collecting garbage. Depending on the optimizations I do, I might need to clean this up
  - This means implementing something like a freelist (set) of holes in the contiguous array
- [ ] string pool (arena) should be interned using a hashmap inside the lexer to avoid duplicate identifiers being used
- [ ] Implement a proper error handling approach with error reporter that pushes errors
- [ ] maybe come up with better way to handle token array shared memory
  - really, its a problem of ownership of memory-- right now the architecture works fine so long as the ownership doesn't get more complicated
- [ ] implement some basic optimizations (tail end recursion, constexpr with constant folding, etc.)
- [ ] optimize hot paths w/ compiler attributes perchance
- [ ] USE GPERF -- seems to be the standard for compiler hash tables

- [x] implement parser ast from tokenarray
- [x] make ast nodeIDs a linked list I think.
  - I don't necessarily need pointers, since I already have nodeIDs.
  - This means I can store the first_child and next_siblings of a node as NodeIDs
- [x] Reorganize directory structure for better maintainability
