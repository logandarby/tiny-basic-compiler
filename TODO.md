- [ ] implement basic emitter
  - After some basic research, it seems like x86-64 assembly might be the best
- [ ] *IMPORTANT:* Looks like the next step is that we need proper semantic analysis for better error handling. We need:
    - Variable analysis (avoid use before defined)
    - Valid expression Analysis (for this, we need static typing)
    - Type analysis (variables will be statically typed to avoid overhead at runtime)

- [ ] Create basic semantic analyzer for variables
- [ ] add comments to lexer
- [ ] right now, the contiguous array of nodes doesn't support deletion without collecting garbage. Depending on the optimizations I do, I might need to clean this up
  - This means implementing something like a freelist (set) of holes in the contiguous array
- [ ] string pool (arena) should be interned using a hashmap inside the lexer to avoid duplicate identifiers being used
    - Make sure the API has const pointers and crap
- [ ] maybe come up with better way to handle token array shared memory
  - really, its a problem of ownership of memory-- right now the architecture works fine so long as the ownership doesn't get more complicated
- [ ] implement some basic optimizations (tail end recursion, constexpr with constant folding, etc.)
- [ ] optimize hot paths w/ compiler attributes perchance
- [ ] USE GPERF -- seems to be the standard for compiler hash tables

- [x] add labels to lexer
- [x] Implement a proper error handling approach with error reporter that pushes errors
- [x] implement parser ast from tokenarray
- [x] make ast nodeIDs a linked list I think.
  - I don't necessarily need pointers, since I already have nodeIDs.
  - This means I can store the first_child and next_siblings of a node as NodeIDs
- [x] Reorganize directory structure for better maintainability
